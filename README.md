# Lab9

To do this lab, I created a very basic website that uses displays dynamic content through showing the date when the button is pressed. The date shown is the actual time that is on your computer when the button is pressed. The website waits for the users input via a click on the button to display the proper date when clicked. To do this, the button adds to the paragraph titled "date".
